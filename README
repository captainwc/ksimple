## How to use this theme?

Just copy this folder to your <blog_root>/themes/. I have no idea to publish this toy to github.

## How to custom this theme?

> refer to [hugo-xmin](https://github.com/yihui/hugo-xmin) and [hugo-admonitions](https://github.com/KKKZOZ/hugo-admonitions)

- Put your [head_custom.html] and [foot_custom.html] to <blog_root>/layouts/paritals/
- Put your [style_custom.css] to <blog_root>/asserts/css/, and edit your head_custom.html like this:
```html
{{ $customCSS := resources.Get "css/style_custom.css" | minify | fingerprint }}
<link rel="stylesheet" href="{{ $customCSS.RelPermalink }}">
```
